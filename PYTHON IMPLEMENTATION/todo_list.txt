- THINK IF IMPOSING THE CORRELATION SON - FATHER

- SO RN WE SHIFT TO A ONLY INFORMATION FIELD VERSION. WE ADDED A LITTLE LAYER FOR THE PRESENCE OF INDIVIDUAL (so not to 
override the information field to store that information) and wow, this is pretty wow. We really could work (on the long terms 
on something even better where we don't really anything else then the information field to decide what to do. That would be great.)

- AN ADULT EAT AS MUCH HE NEED TO OBTAIN THE ENERGY + A LITTLE AMOUNT (like + some function of the peace zone just to go out the food and be alone)

- ALL THE INITIAL DISTRIBUTION MUST BE IMPLEMENTED IN THEIR CORRISPECTIVE CLASS NON IN THE INITIAL_CONDITION_HANDLER

- THINK AT THE -off-graphic SIMULATION (what if we have milion of individual? we can't visualize everything)

- THERE'S TO SAY I COULD HAVE IMPLEMENTED ALL WITH VECTOR MOVEMENT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER AT A CERTAINT POINT LOL

- FOR SOME REASONS THE LEGITIMACY CHECKER IS NOT WORKING AS IT SHOULD

- IMPLEMENTING A REPORT SCHEDULE
for every run we must give an easy report schedule into a file
we must decide statistic we want to store
