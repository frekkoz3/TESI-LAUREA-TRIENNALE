- IMPLEMENTING THE DECISION PROCESSES
idea of the communication level
this is pretty huge in fact

- HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW IS IT WORKING RN

- IMPLEMENTING THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SYSTEM for the DECISION
- IMPLEMENTING THE KNOWLEDGE DISTRIBUTION for the decision
- remember to have two different decision protocol -> one for young one for old

- IMPLEMENTING A REPORT SCHEDULE
for every run we must give an easy report schedule into a file
we must decide statistic we want to store

- THINK IF IMPOSING THE CORRELATION SON - FATHER

- ALL THE INITIAL DISTRIBUTION MUST BE IMPLEMENTED IN THEIR CORRISPECTIVE CLASS NON IN THE INITIAL_CONDITION_HANDLER

- THINK AT THE -off-graphic SIMULATION (what if we have milion of individual? we can't visualize everything)

- PROBABLY PARALLELIZE EVERYTHING
Not so happy but when you know you know

- THERE'S TO SAY I COULD HAVE IMPLEMENTED ALL WITH VECTOR MOVEMENT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER AT A CERTAINT POINT LOL
