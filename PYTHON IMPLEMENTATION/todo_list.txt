- IMPLEMENTING AN INTERFACE FOR SETTING INITIAL CONDITION
FOR THE INTERFACE WE NEED TO REGOLATE:
population size
population initial distribution on the surface
population initial parameters distribution 
population avg max energy
population avg max age
world density cell
world init mode (uniform, center based ecc)
mutation rate
action cost
-> the settings can be both loaded or saved into a file 
where to save the schedule report

- IMPLEMENTING THE CONFLICT HANDLER
we must even decide what happens during a space conflict

- IMPLEMENTING THE DECISION PROCESSES
idea of the communication level
this is pretty huge in fact

- IMPLEMENTING THE BASAL METABOLISM
I forgot lol

- IMPLEMENTING A REPORT SCHEDULE
for every run we must give an easy report schedule into a file
we must decide statistic we want to store

- POSSIBLY WE CAN ADD SOME COOL SPRITES 

- THINK AT THE -off-graphic SIMULATION (what if we have milion of individual? we can't visualize everything)
(we should be able both of fixing the focus on a part of the world and then scroll with the mouse and 
just seeing the stats in real time)

- PROBABLY PARALLELIZE EVERYTHING
Not so happy but when you know you know
