- IMPLEMENTING THE CONFLICT HANDLER
we must even decide what happens during a space conflict

- ALL THE INITIAL DISTRIBUTION MUST BE IMPLEMENTED IN THEIR CORRISPECTIVE CLASS NON IN THE INITIAL_CONDITION_HANDLER

- IMPLEMENTING THE DECISION PROCESSES
idea of the communication level
this is pretty huge in fact

- IMPLEMENTING THE BASAL METABOLISM
I forgot lol

- IMLPEMENTING A GOOD MUTATION SISTEM
right now it does not work properly

- IMPLEMENTING A REPORT SCHEDULE
for every run we must give an easy report schedule into a file
we must decide statistic we want to store

- POSSIBLY WE CAN ADD SOME COOL SPRITES 

- THINK AT THE -off-graphic SIMULATION (what if we have milion of individual? we can't visualize everything)
(we should be able both of fixing the focus on a part of the world and then scroll with the mouse and 
just seeing the stats in real time)

- PROBABLY PARALLELIZE EVERYTHING
Not so happy but when you know you know

- THE INITIAL CONDITION SETTINGS HAVE TO BE A LITTLE TWEAKED BECAUSE THE SLIDER IS GOOD ONLY FOR VALUE IN THE RANGE 0-100
